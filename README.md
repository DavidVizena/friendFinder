# friendFinder

I actually was unable to finish this assignment. My son is fairly sick, had to take him for chest xrays to see if he has pneumonia. Hes on antibiotics and a cough medicing so strong its designed for 2 year olds (hes 14 months). I will pseudocode out the rest of what I havent finished like the assignment says.

So the only step I didnt do is step 6, the math part, I actaully have already coded out the modal (step 7). All i needed to do was make a comparison statement comparing the difference between the numbers chosen in the array to give you a total difference between the inputs entered into the survey, and the 3 static ppl i made for friends.js. It would then push the results into the modal I made.

if you look at the console it console.logs the results of the users input correctly, so the call is being made, and the response is being recieved correctly.
